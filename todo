1- wal backup functionality (wal just for recovery, only read from it when you start the program and the offset is not at the end)
2- add checksum
3- compact sst files
4- tests tests tests


in order to do 1-, i first need to implement the checkpoint mechanism

add a feature such that we can delete any value we want (it doesnt have to be present already) (or not ?)

look if there's a way to always flush before closing the program
